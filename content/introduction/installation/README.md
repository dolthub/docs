# Installation

Dolt is extremely simple to install. Dolt is a single \~50 megabyte program. To install it, you download or compile that program and put it on your `PATH`. For each operating system, we created simpler, more familiar methods of installation.

* [Linux](linux.md)
* [Windows](windows.md)
* [Mac](mac.md)

Dolt is free and open source. You always have the option to build from source. This is also the best option if you want to use unreleased features or bug fixes.

* [Build from Source](source.md)

If you want to run Dolt as a MySQL compatible server, we have additional instructions on how to do that on a Linux host or with Docker.

* [Application Server](application-server.md)
* [Docker](docker.md)
