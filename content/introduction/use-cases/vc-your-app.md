# Version Control Your Application

Would your application be better if it supported branches, merges, and differences? Do you want to add a pull request workflow? Dolt allows you to support these features without building a really complicated schema.

Connect to Dolt like any other SQL database. Use Dolt's SQL functions to control the versioning writes. Use Dolt system tables to support versioning reads.

Dolt allows you to add Git-style version control to your application.
