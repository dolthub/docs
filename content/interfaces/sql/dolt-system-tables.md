SET @@mydb_head = COMMIT("my commit message")

INSERT INTO dolt_branches (name, hash)
VALUES ("my branch name", @@mydb_head);
```

### `dolt_commit_diff_$TABLENAME`

### Description 

For every user table named `$TABLENAME`, there is a queryable system table named `dolt_commit_diff_$TABLENAME` which can be queried to see how a table has changed between two commits (regardless of which branch the user is currently using). Each row in the result set represents a row that has changed between two commits.

### Schema

```text
+-------------+------+
| field       | type |
+-------------+------+
| from_commit | TEXT |
| to_commit   | TEXT |
| diff_type   | TEXT |
+-------------+------+
```

The remaining columns will be dependent on the schema of the user table. For every column X in your table at `from_commit`, there will be a column in the result set named `from_$X` with the same type as `X`, and for every column `Y` in your table at `to_commit` there will be a column in the result set named `to_$Y` with the same type as `Y`. The `from_commit` and `to_commit` parameters must both be filled.

`dolt_commit_diff_$TABLENAME` is more similar to the `dolt diff` CLI command than the `dolt_diff_$TABLENAME` table. It represents the [two-dot diff](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Revision-Selection#double_dot) between the two commits provided.

### Example Schema

Let us consider a simple example with a table that has two columns. Consider the table 

```text
+--------------+
| field | type |
+--------------+
| pk    | int  |
| val   | int  |
+--------------+
```

We see that the structure of the `dolt_commit_diff_$TABLENAME` will be. 

```text
+------------------+----------+
| field            | type     |
+------------------+----------+
| to_pk            | int      |
| to_val           | int      |
| to_commit        | longtext |  
| to_commit_date   | datetime |
| from_pk          | int      | 
| from_val         | int      |
| from_commit      | longtext |
| from_commit_date | datetime |
+------------------+----------+
```
### Query Details

Let us now consider the following branch structure:

```text
      A---B---C feature
     /
D---E---F---G master
```

We can use the above table to represent two types of diffs. A two point diff and a three point diff. In a 
two point diff we want to see the difference in rows between Point C and Point G. To do that we can simply do

```SQL
SELECT * from dolt_commif_diff_$TABLENAME where to_commit=HASHOF('feature') and from_commit = HASHOF('master');
```

We can also compute a 3 point diff using this table. In a 3 point diff we want to see how our feature branch has diverged from our common ancestor E. We can do the following queries

```SQL
SELECT * FROM dolt_commit_diff_$TABLENAME WHERE to_commit=HASHOF('feature') and from_commit=dolt_merge_base('master', 'feature');
```
The function `dolt_merge_base` computes the closest ancestore E between `master` and `feature`.

### Additional Notes

There is one special `to_commit` value `WORKING` which can be used to see what changes are in the working set that have yet to be committed to HEAD. It is often useful to use the `HASHOF()` function to get the commit hash of a branch, or an anscestor commit. The above table requires both `from_commit` and `to_commit` to be filled. 

### `dolt_diff_$TABLENAME`

#### Description

For every user table named `$TABLENAME`, there is a queryable system table named `dolt_diff_$TABLENAME` which can be queried to see how rows have changed over time. Each row in the result set represents a row that has changed between two commits. Compared to the `dolt_commit_diff_$TABLENAME` the `dolt_diff_$TABLENAME` focuses on how a particular row has evolved over time through the current branch. 

#### Schema

Every Dolt diff table will have the columns

```text
+-------------+------+
| field       | type |
+-------------+------+
| from_commit | TEXT |
| to_commit   | TEXT |
| diff_type   | TEXT |
+-------------+------+
```

The remaining columns will be dependent on the schema of the user table. For every column X in your table at `from_commit`, there will be a column in the result set named `from_$X` with the same type as `X`, and for every column `Y` in your table at `to_commit` there will be a column in the result set named `to_$Y` with the same type as `Y`.

#### Example Schema

For a hypothetical table named states with a schema that changes between `from_commit` and `to_commit` as shown below

```text
# schema at from_commit    # schema at to_commit
+------------+--------+    +------------+--------+
| field      | type   |    | field      | type   |
+------------+--------+    +------------+--------+
| state      | TEXT   |    | state      | TEXT   |
| population | BIGINT |    | population | BIGINT |
+------------+--------+    | area       | BIGINT |
                           +-------------+-------+
```

The schema for `dolt_diff_states` would be

```text
+-----------------+--------+
| field           | type   |
+-----------------+--------+
| from_state      | TEXT   |
| to_state        | TEXT   |
| from_population | BIGINT |
| to_population   | BIGINT |
| to_state        | TEXT   |
| from_commit     | TEXT   |
| to_commit       | TEXT   |
| diff_type       | TEXT   |
+-----------------+--------+
```

#### Query Details

Doing a `SELECT *` query for a diff table will show you every change that has occurred to each row for every commit in this branches history. Using `to_commit` and `from_commit` you can limit the data to specific commits. There is one special `to_commit` value `WORKING` which can be used to see what changes are in the working set that have yet to be committed to HEAD. It is often useful to use the `HASHOF()` function to get the commit hash of a branch, or an anscestor commit. To get the differences between the last commit and it's parent you could use `to_commit=HASHOF("HEAD") and from_commit=HASHOF("HEAD^")`

For each row the field `diff_type` will be one of the values `added`, `modified`, or `removed`. You can filter which rows appear in the result set to one or more of those `diff_type` values in order to limit which types of changes will be returned.

#### Example Query

Taking the [`dolthub/wikipedia-ngrams`](https://www.dolthub.com/repositories/dolthub/wikipedia-ngrams) data repository from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/) as our example, the following query will retrieve the bigrams whose total counts have changed the most between 2 versions.

```sql
SELECT from_bigram, to_bigram, from_total_count, to_total_count, ABS(to_total_count-from_total_count) AS delta
FROM dolt_diff_bigram_counts
WHERE from_commit = HASHOF("HEAD~3") AND diff_type = "modified"
ORDER BY delta DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

```text
+-------------+-------------+------------------+----------------+-------+
| from_bigram | to_bigram   | from_total_count | to_total_count | delta |
+-------------+-------------+------------------+----------------+-------+
| of the      | of the      | 21566470         | 21616678       | 50208 |

+-------------+-------------+------------------+----------------+-------+
```

### `dolt_docs`

#### Description

System table that stores the contents of Dolt docs \(`LICENSE.md`, `README.md`\).

#### Schema

```text
+----------+------+
| field    | type |
+----------+------+
| doc_name | text |
| doc_text | text |
+----------+------+
```

#### Usage

Dolt users do not have to be familiar with this system table in order to make a `LICENSE.md` or `README.md`. Simply run `dolt init` or `touch README.md` and `touch LICENSE.md` from a Dolt repository to get started. Then, `dolt add` and `dolt commit` the docs like you would a table.

### `dolt_history_$TABLENAME`

#### Description

For every user table named $TABLENAME, there is a queryable system table named dolt\_history\_$TABLENAME which can be queried to find a rows value at every commit in the current branches commit graph.

#### Schema

Every Dolt history table will have the columns

```text
+-------------+----------+
| field       | type     |
+-------------+----------+
| commit_hash | TEXT     |
| committer   | TEXT     |
| commit_date | DATETIME |
+-------------+----------+
```

The rest of the columns will be the superset of all columns that have existed throughout the history of the table. As the query.

#### Example Schema

For a hypothetical data repository with the following commit graph:

```text
   A
  / \
 B   C
      \
       D
```

Which has a table named states with the following schemas at each commit:

```text
# schema at A              # schema at B              # schema at C              # schema at D
+------------+--------+    +------------+--------+    +------------+--------+    +------------+--------+
| field      | type   |    | field      | type   |    | field      | type   |    | field      | type   |
+------------+--------+    +------------+--------+    +------------+--------+    +------------+--------+
| state      | TEXT   |    | state      | TEXT   |    | state      | TEXT   |    | state      | TEXT   |
| population | BIGINT |    | population | BIGINT |    | population | BIGINT |    | population | BIGINT |
+------------+--------+    | capital    | TEXT   |    | area       | BIGINT |    | area       | BIGINT |
                           +------------+--------+    +------------+--------+    | counties   | BIGINT |
                                                                                 +------------+--------+
```

The schema for dolt\_history\_states would be:

```text
+-------------+----------+
| field       | type     |
+-------------+----------+
| state       | TEXT     |
| population  | BIGINT   |
| capital     | TEXT     |
| area        | BIGINT   |
| counties    | BIGINT   |
| commit_hash | TEXT     |
| committer   | TEXT     |
| commit_date | DATETIME |
+-------------+----------+
```

#### Example Query

Taking the above table as an example. If the data inside dates for each commit was:

* At commit "A" the state data from 1790
* At commit "B" the state data from 1800
* At commit "C" the state data from 1800
* At commit "D" the state data from 1810

```sql
SELECT *
FROM dolt_history_states
WHERE state = "Virginia";
```

```text
+----------+------------+----------+--------+----------+-------------+-----------+---------------------------------+
| state    | population | capital  | area   | counties | commit_hash | committer | commit_date                     |
+----------+------------+----------+--------+----------+-------------+-----------+---------------------------------+
| Virginia | 691937     | <NULL>   | <NULL> | <NULL>   | HASH_AT(A)  | billybob  | 1790-01-09 00:00:00.0 +0000 UTC |
| Virginia | 807557     | Richmond | <NULL> | <NULL>   | HASH_AT(B)  | billybob  | 1800-01-01 00:00:00.0 +0000 UTC |
| Virginia | 807557     | <NULL>   | 42774  | <NULL>   | HASH_AT(C)  | billybob  | 1800-01-01 00:00:00.0 +0000 UTC |
| Virginia | 877683     | <NULL>   | 42774  | 99       | HASH_AT(D)  | billybob  | 1810-01-01 00:00:00.0 +0000 UTC |
+----------+------------+----------+--------+----------+-------------+-----------+---------------------------------+

# Note in the real result set there would be actual commit hashes for each row.  Here I have used notation that is
# easier to understand how it relates to our commit graph and the data associated with each commit above
```

### `dolt_log`

#### Description

Queryable system table which shows the commit log

#### Schema

```text
+-------------+----------+
| field       | type     |
+-------------+--------- +
| commit_hash | text     |
| committer   | text     |
| email       | text     |
| date        | datetime |
| message     | text     |
+-------------+--------- +
```

#### Example Query

```sql
SELECT *
FROM dolt_log
WHERE committer = "bheni" and date > "2019-04-01"
ORDER BY "date";
```

```text
+----------------------------------+-----------+--------------------+-----------------------------------+---------------+

+----------------------------------+-----------+--------------------+-----------------------------------+---------------+
```

### `dolt_procedures`

#### Description

System table that stores each stored procedure that has been created on the database.

#### Schema

```text
+-------------+----------+
| field       | type     |
+-------------+----------+
| name        | longtext |
| create_stmt | longtext |
| created_at  | datetime |
| modified_at | datetime |
+-------------+----------+
```

When using the standard `CREATE PROCEDURE` workflow, the `name` column will always be lowercase. Dolt assumes that `name` is always lowercase as a result, and manually inserting a stored procedure must also have a lowercase `name`. Otherwise, it will be invisible to some operations, such as `DROP PROCEDURE`.

The values in this table are implementation details associated with the storage of stored procedures.

#### Example Query

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE p1(x INT) SELECT x;
SELECT * FROM dolt_procedures;
```

```text
+------+-------------------------------------+-------------------------------+-------------------------------+
| name | create_stmt                         | created_at                    | modified_at                   |
+------+-------------------------------------+-------------------------------+-------------------------------+
| p1   | CREATE PROCEDURE p1(x INT) SELECT x | 2021-03-04 00:00:000+0000 UTC | 2021-03-04 00:00:000+0000 UTC |
+------+-------------------------------------+-------------------------------+-------------------------------+
```

### `dolt_schemas`

#### Description

SQL Schema fragments for a dolt database value that are versioned alongside the database itself. Certain DDL statements will modify this table and the value of this table in a SQL session will affect what database entities exist in the session.

#### Schema

```text
+-------------+----------+
| field       | type     |
+-------------+--------- +
| type        | text     |
| name        | text     |
| fragment    | text     |
+-------------+--------- +
```

Currently on view definitions are stored in `dolt_schemas`. `type` is currently always the string `view`. `name` is the name of the view as supplied in the `CREATE VIEW ...` statement. `fragment` is the `select` fragment that the view is defined as.

The values in this table are partly implementation details associated with the implementation of the underlying database objects.

#### Example Query

```sql
CREATE VIEW four AS SELECT 2+2 FROM dual;
SELECT * FROM dolt_schemas;
```

```text
+------+------+----------------------+
| type | name | fragment             |
+------+------+----------------------+
| view | four | select 2+2 from dual |
+------+------+----------------------+
```

### `dolt_status`

#### Description

Queryable system table which shows the commit log

#### Schema

```text
+------------+---------+------+-----+
| Field      | Type    | Null | Key |
+------------+---------+------+-----+
| table_name | text    | NO   | PRI |
| staged     | tinyint | NO   |     |
| status     | text    | NO   |     |
+------------+---------+------+-----+
```

#### Example Query

```sql
SELECT *
FROM dolt_status
WHERE staged=false;
```

```text
+------------+--------+-----------+
| table_name | staged | status    |
+------------+--------+-----------+
| one_pk     | false  | new table |
+------------+--------+-----------+
```
