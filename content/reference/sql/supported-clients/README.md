title: Supported Clients
---

Dolt is MySQL compatible. Any MySQL client should be able to connect
to a running Dolt SQL Server. If you find a client that is not
compatible with Dolt, please [file an
issue](https://github.com/dolthub/dolt/issues/new) and let us know.

We have actively tested the following clients, separated by type.

* [Programmatic Clients](clients.md)
* [SQL Editors](sql-editors.md)
* [Spreadsheets](spreadsheets.md)
* [Notebooks](notebooks.md)
