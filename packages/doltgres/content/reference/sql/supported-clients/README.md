Doltgres is Postgres compatible. Any Postgres client should be able to connect to a running Doltgres
Server. If you find a client that is not compatible with Doltgres, please [file an
issue](https://github.com/dolthub/dolt/issues/new) and let us know.

We have actively tested the following clients, separated by type.
