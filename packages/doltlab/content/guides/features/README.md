DoltLab has all the features of [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com). DoltHub is modeled after GitHub and thus supports, viewing and editing databases on the web, Pull Requests, Issues, Permissions, and many other features. These features should be easy to understand and self-documenting. 

Some more esoteric features require specific documentation, like:
* The [DoltLab API](./api.md)
* [Workspaces](./workspaces.md)
* [Transforming File Uploads](./transform-uploads.md)
