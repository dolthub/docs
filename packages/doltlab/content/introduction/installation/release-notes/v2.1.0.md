# DoltLab v2.1.0
Download at https://doltlab-releases.s3.amazonaws.com/linux/amd64/doltlab-v2.1.0.zip

## DoltLab Features/Bug Fixes
### Breaking Changes
* The DoltLab `.zip` folder now contains the [installer](https://docs.dolthub.com/products/doltlab/installation#start-doltlab) binary that must be used to configure the DoltLab instance. Previous versions of DoltLab shipped with assets like `docker-compose.yaml` and `envoy.tmpl`, however these assets, and any others that are required for running DoltLab, will now be generated by the `installer` and are NOT included in the zip.

## DoltHub Features/Bug Fixes
* Fix merge pull request when existing Job is running.
* Misc. UI design changes and bug fixes.
