# What is Dolt?

![](../.gitbook/assets/dolt-preview.png)

Dolt is a SQL database you can fork, clone, branch, merge, push and pull just like a Git repository. Connect to Dolt just like any MySQL database to run SQL queries. Use the command line interface to import CSV files, commit your changes, push them to a remote, or merge your teammate's changes.

All the commands you know from Git work exactly the same in Dolt. Git versions files, Dolt versions tables. It's like Git and MySQL had a baby.

Dolt is a [version controlled database](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2021-09-17-database-version-control/). Dolt is [Git for Data](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2020-03-06-so-you-want-git-for-data/). Dolt is a [Versioned MySQL Replica](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-02-17-binlog-replication-preview/).

## Version Controlled Database

Dolt is a [version controlled SQL database](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2021-09-17-database-version-control/). Connect to Dolt just like any MySQL database to run SQL queries. Use Dolt [system tables](../reference/sql/version-control/dolt-system-tables.md), [functions](../reference/sql/version-control/dolt-sql-functions.md), or [procedures](../reference/sql/version-control/dolt-sql-procedures.md) to access version control information and features.

## Git for Data

Dolt is [Git for data](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2020-03-06-so-you-want-git-for-data/). [Dolt matches the Git CLI exactly](../reference/cli/cli.md). When you would have run `git add`, you run `dolt add`. When you would have run `git commit`, you run `dolt commit`.

## Versioned MySQL Replica

Dolt can be deployed as a [Versioned MySQL Replica](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-03-15-getting-started-versioned-mysql-replica/). Because Dolt is MySQL compatible, Dolt can be configured just like any other MySQL replica. A Dolt replica gives you features of a [version controlled database](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2021-09-17-database-version-control/) without migrating from MySQL.

We also built [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com), a place to share Dolt databases. We host public data for free! DoltHub adds a modern, secure, always on database management web GUI to the Dolt ecosystem. Edit your database on the web, have another person review it via a pull request, and have the production database pull it to deploy.

Not ready to put your databases on the internet, no matter the permissions? We have a self-hosted version of DoltHub we call [DoltLab](https://www.doltlab.com). DoltLab gives you all the features of DoltHub, wherever you want them, in your own network or on your development machine.
